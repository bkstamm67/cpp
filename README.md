Example C++ Programs

All of the programs saved here are basic programs I was assigned to complete while
in school.  Most of the programs run without issues, however, there are some with 
some issues.  Also, the programming is not optimized either.  For example, most of 
the sorting functions I use during this semester with these programs are "complex" 
if/else if/else statements, where there are numerous algorithms which would be better 
suited.  These programs, instead, focused on learning the basics of programming.

There are some simple programs here in the repo, and also there are some more complex 
ones held in sub-repos.  Comments and explanations are included in the files.
