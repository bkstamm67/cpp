Example C++ Programs

All of the programs saved here are basic programs I was assigned to complete while
in school.  Most of the programs run without issues, however, there are some with 
issues / not optimized.  For example, most of the sorting functions I use in these
programs are "complex" if/else if/else statements, where there are numerous algorithms
which would be better suited.  These programs, instead, focused on learning the basics
of programming.

As the file size increases, there is an increase in complexity.  When referring to 
groups of programs, I just refer to the "parent" programs (ie - program1.cpp & program1.hpp, I
just write program1) and capitalize the program with main (ie - program1, program2, PROGRAMMAIN).
Here is a brief discription of what is in each:

one - six simple programs, which takes a user's input and does something with it

two - nine simple programs, mostly doing various actions with numbers.  fileAdder.cpp
does read from a file and creates a new file.

three - 5 programs, all with corresponding header files.  Show basic understanding of 
header files and creation of simple objects.

four - 6 progams - 3 of which are simple programs.  There is a tic tac toe game 
(board & TICTACTOE), a shopping cart (SHOPCART & Item), and another sphere program (Sphere & 
SPHEREMAIN).

five - 4 programs, with one showing ability to sort objects (SPHERESORT and Sphere)

six - 5 programs, all using recursive functions.

seven - 2 programs, one which focuses on inherence (Rectangle & SQUARE)

eight - More inherence with one group (CustomerProject, PreferredProject, RegularProject & TEST).

final - A library program.  Main is in MENU.
